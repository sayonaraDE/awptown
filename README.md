# AWP Town
AWP Town is a created community map by Sayonara for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

Check this map together out. Alone, it's silent, dark and not safe. Play it together and hold your site. What you can expect from this map?

- [x] Don't be alone! Play up to 32 players online!
- [x] Move on other sites, to kill the enemy as silent as you can.
- [x] Hide behind objects, but not every object can give safety. Be careful!
- [x] You don't like the AWP? Use the Scout!
- [x] Look at every corner, the enemy is everywhere!
- [x] This map will be updated until Summer 2016.
- [x] Get ready for a big update soon!
- [x] You will have fun, if you play with more players than 1vs1!

With another words, enjoy it! I would be very happy about a review and show me if you like it or not.
