{"name":"AWP Town","tagline":"AWP Town is a created community map by Sayonara for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive","body":"### Welcome to AWP Town!\r\nThis map is my second big map. Why I called this AWP Town? The plan was to play on 1 ground, there should be some towers, where you can get up via ladder. I was very new to Hammer Editor and I didn't knew how to this. Today I would call myself a professionell map creator in Coutner-Strike: Global Offensive. But wait! You can update the map and add some towers? Yes, I can do that, but my mind says: Don't do that! It would completly destroy my new update and I would build everything again. \r\n\r\n### Setup of AWP Town\r\nThe setup is pretty simple, it's nothing big. There are 2 sides. The CT-Side and the T-Side. You will spawn on of the sides on the middle stage. There are 3 stages. The upper \"Welcome Lounge\", the middle \"Central House\" and of course the lowerst \"Cellar\". I am working a new big update, where are these names represented. I fit the names to the map, so that everything looks fine. Of cource in the cellar, it is dark, you're afraid and full customized ambience. Full of dramatic. More soon!\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n- How long did I need to create this map?<br>\r\nI am quite not sure, but I think, I created this map in less than 2 weeks! <br><br>\r\n\r\n- It was planed, that this map gone popular?<br>\r\nAbsolutely not that far. <br><br>\r\n\r\n- Is the new update getting a new map?<br>\r\nI would say so.
