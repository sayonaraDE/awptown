<p>This map is my second big map. Why I called this AWP Town? The plan was to play on 1 ground, there should be some towers, where you can get up via ladder. I was very new to Hammer Editor and I didn't knew how to this. Today I would call myself a professionell map creator in Coutner-Strike: Global Offensive. But wait! You can update the map and add some towers? Yes, i can do that, but my mind says: Don't do that! It would completly destroy my new update and I would build everything again. </p>

<p>The setup is pretty simple, it's nothing big. There are 2 sides. The CT-Side and the T-Side. You will spawn on of the sides on the middle stage. There are 3 stages. The upper "Welcome Lounge", the middle "Central House" and of course the lowerst "Cellar". I am working a new big update, where are these names represented. I fit the names to the map, so that everything looks fine. Of cource in the cellar, it is dark, you're afraid and full customized ambience. Full of dramatic. More soon!</p>
